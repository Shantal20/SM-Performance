	<p> As a new and upcoming business in the modern-day society, where technology is ever growing and developing.<BR>
	The purpose of creating a website of this sort is to: to promote the business to gain more clients, 
	to provide customers with<br> a faster response and feedback time, 
	to give customers the opportunity to purchase and receive their spare parts at the comfort of<br> their 
	homes and work place and to allow clients to make online next day appointments for vehicle repairs.
	</P>
	<p> The website would give customers the opportunity to leave reviews so that other users can see as well. <br>These reviews would help the business grow and make changes where necessary. 
	</P>
